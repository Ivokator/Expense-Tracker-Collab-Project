## Reflection

The biggest challenge for this group project was debugging Textual, as sometimes it did unexpected things, the solution was sometimes unintuitive, and that we had to work around certain limitations and features to create this project. We slowly adapted and got used to how Textual functions. 

We think collaborative coding is interesting, as it allows for feedback and support from other group members. We also think that collaborative coding is sometimes more enjoyable than working alone, as you have others to communicate with.
